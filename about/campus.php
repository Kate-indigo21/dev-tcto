            Starting in 1964 as Mindanao State University
            Preparatory High School in Bongao, Tawi-Tawi, a mere
            adjunct to MSU Marawi Preparatory High School, MSU
            Tawi-Tawi College of Technology and Oceanography has
            grown into an institution of academic excellence. More
            secondary schools were established from 1967 to 1977 in
            the outlying island municipalities of Tawi-Tawi. By
            1990, 20 high schools were put up throughout the
            province. In 1984, MSU-TCTO Science High School and
            MSU-TCTO Child Development Center – Laboratory
            Elementary School were established.
